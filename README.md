# ESP8266-Digital-Compass-with-RM3100-Magnetometer
This project transforms an ESP8266 microcontroller and a PNI RM3100 magnetometer into a precise digital compass. The firmware reads the raw magnetic field data, calibrates it, and calculates a heading in degrees (0-360), which is then output over the serial port.
